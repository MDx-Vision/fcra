I can see this is a handwritten note on lined paper, but I'm not able to make out most of the text clearly enough to provide an accurate transcription. The handwriting appears to be in pencil and is quite difficult to read in this image.

From what I can partially make out, this appears to be personal notes rather than an official credit reporting agency response letter. Credit reporting agency responses are typically formal, typed documents that include:

- Company letterhead
- Formal formatting
- Clear case/reference numbers
- Specific investigation results
- Official language and terminology

If you have a credit reporting agency response letter that you need help reading, I'd recommend:
1. Taking a clearer, well-lit photo if possible
2. Scanning the document if it's an official typed letter
3. Contacting the credit reporting agency directly if you're having trouble reading their response

If this is indeed an official document that you're having trouble reading, a clearer image would help me provide a more accurate transcription.

I can see this is a handwritten note on lined paper, but I cannot make out most of the text clearly enough to provide an accurate transcription. The handwriting appears to be in cursive/script style which makes it difficult to read with certainty.

From what I can partially make out, this appears to be personal notes rather than an official credit reporting agency response letter. Credit reporting agency responses are typically typed formal documents that include:

- Company letterhead
- Clear case/reference numbers
- Formal language about investigations
- Specific dates
- Official signatures

If you need help with an actual credit report dispute response, I'd be happy to help interpret that document if you can provide a clearer image or a typed version. For this handwritten note, you might want to ask the person who wrote it to clarify the content, as I cannot reliably transcribe the handwriting.
