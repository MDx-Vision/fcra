Got you, let’s get it back to usable.

Given what we just added, the most likely culprit for “can’t click on anything” is the new full-screen overlay sitting on top of the page and never being hidden (or being rendered with the `visible` class by accident), so it’s blocking all clicks.

Here’s a quick, safe patch to make the app responsive again, even if the overlay misbehaves.

---

## 1. Make the overlay non-blocking by default

In **`templates/litigation_review.html`**, find the `.overlay` CSS and replace that block with this:

```css
.overlay {
  position: fixed;
  inset: 0;
  background: rgba(255,255,255,0.7);
  display: none;            /* hidden by default */
  align-items: center;
  justify-content: center;
  z-index: 999;
  pointer-events: none;     /* <-- key: do NOT block clicks when hidden */
}

.overlay.visible {
  display: flex;
  pointer-events: auto;     /* <-- only block clicks when we explicitly show it */
}
```

That alone stops a “stuck overlay” from blocking the whole UI.

Also quickly confirm your HTML has:

```html
<div class="overlay" id="overlay">
  ...
</div>
```

and **does NOT** have `class="overlay visible"` anywhere.
If you see `visible` in that class list, remove it.

## 2. Add a defensive hide on page load

Still in `litigation_review.html` at the bottom of your `<script>` block, just before `// Initial load`, add:

```js
// Make sure overlay is hidden on initial load, even if CSS or previous state was weird
hideOverlay();
```

So you end with:

```js
  downloadAllBtn.addEventListener('click', () => {
    setStatus('Preparing ZIP of all PDFs…');
    window.location.href = `/api/analysis/${ANALYSIS_ID}/download_all`;
  });

  // Make sure overlay starts hidden
  hideOverlay();

  // Initial load
  loadPage();
</script>
```

This guarantees we don’t accidentally start in a “blocked” state.

---

## 3. If the whole app still won’t load at all

If you’re seeing a generic “Application error” or blank page:

1. Open the Replit **Console** and look for a Python traceback.
2. If you see `NameError: name 're' is not defined` coming from `approve_analysis_stage_1`, add this **near the top** of `app.py` with your other imports:

   ```python
   import re
   import io
   import zipfile
   ```

   (You already import `io`/`zipfile` inside the download endpoint, but having them at the top is fine.)

Those are the only pieces from the last patch that could break things globally.

---

Try those two front-end changes first, refresh the `/analysis/<id>/review` page, and you should be able to click around again.

If it’s still frozen, tell me exactly what you see (white page, error banner, etc.), and I’ll target the next fix.
