**BETTER BUSINESS BUREAU COMPLAINT TEMPLATE**

**Use this template if the Unknown Creditor is a collection agency**

**Complaint Portal:** www.bbb.org

**Business Name:** [Unknown Creditor Name - to be determined]

**Complaint Category:** Billing/Collection Issues

**Problem Description:**
"I am not liable for the debt referenced as account 428184***. I have never had a contractual relationship with this company. This account appears to be the result of identity theft, for which I have filed police report case number [CASE NUMBER] and FTC report [FTC NUMBER].

The company has failed to provide proper debt validation documentation when requested, including the original signed contract establishing my liability for this debt. Under the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act, they are required to provide verification of the debt upon request.

I have submitted identity theft documentation to the credit reporting agencies requesting this fraudulent account be blocked under FCRA Section 605B."

**Desired Resolution:**
"I request this company immediately:
1. Remove this account from my credit reports
2. Cease all collection activities
3. Provide written confirmation that the account has been closed
4. Acknowledge this account was opened fraudulently"

**Supporting Documentation to Upload:**
- Copy of police report
- Copy of FTC Identity Theft Report
- Copy of government ID
- Copy of credit report showing the account

**Expected Timeline:**
BBB typically requests business response within 14 days. Many collection agencies will delete rather than respond to BBB complaints.
