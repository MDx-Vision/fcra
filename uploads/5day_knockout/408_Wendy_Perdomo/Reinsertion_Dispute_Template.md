**RE: Improper Reinsertion Violation - FCRA Section 611(a)(5)(B)**
**Account:** Unknown Creditor 428184***

Dear Sir or Madam:

I am writing to report a violation of the Fair Credit Reporting Act. The account referenced above was previously deleted from my credit file as a result of identity theft blocking under FCRA Section 605B.

**VIOLATION:**
This account has been reinserted onto my credit report WITHOUT the required written notice within five (5) business days as mandated by 15 U.S.C. § 1681i(a)(5)(B)(ii).

**LEGAL REQUIREMENT:**
Under FCRA Section 611(a)(5)(B)(ii), when a consumer reporting agency deletes information and subsequently reinserts it, the agency must provide written notice to the consumer within five (5) business days of the reinsertion.

**FACTS:**
- Account was previously blocked/deleted on: [DATE]
- Account reappeared on credit report: [DATE]
- No written notice was received within 5 business days

**DEMAND:**
Pursuant to FCRA Section 611(a)(5)(B)(ii), I demand:
1. Immediate deletion of this improperly reinserted account
2. Written confirmation of deletion within 15 days
3. Notification to all furnishers of this information

**CONSEQUENCES OF NON-COMPLIANCE:**
Failure to comply may result in:
- CFPB complaint
- State Attorney General complaint
- Private legal action for willful FCRA violations

Respectfully,

Wendy Perdomo
