FTC Identity Theft Affidavit Example Text:   I am  fi ling this FTC Identity Theft A ffi davit to report 3 separate fraudulent accounts appearing   on my consumer FICO credit report which I do not recognize as reported and which are the   result of identity theft and fraud. These fraudulent accounts consist of a personal credit card   account opened at American Express on April 28th, 2022 under the account number (private),   an auto loan account opened at Navy Federal Credit Union on March 13th, 2023 under the   account number (private), and a personal loan account opened at Pentagon Federal Credit   Union on February 9th, 2023 under the account number (private).
