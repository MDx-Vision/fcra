## Bank-by-Bank Strategies

### American Express (Amex)

#### Strategy: New Client (No Existing Relationship)

1. **Month 1**: Apply for Delta Business Gold (co-branded card)
   - Expected limit: ~$10k
   - Establishes relationship with usable limit

2. **Month 2** (30 days later): Apply for Blue Business Plus (0% card)
   - Expected limit: $20-30k
   - Transfer limit from Delta card if needed

3. **Month 3** (30 days later): Apply for Blue Business Cash (second 0%)
   - Expected limit: $20-30k

#### Strategy: Existing Relationship

1. Apply for Business Gold (charge card) - starts relationship
2. Wait 30 days → First 0% card ($20-30k)
3. Wait 30 days → Second 0% card ($20-30k)

#### B-Lock (Business Line of Credit)

- **Requirement**: 1-2 year old LLC (1 year minimum confirmed working)
- **Process**: Get both business cards approved → immediately apply for B-Lock
- **Expected**: $25-50k instant approval

#### Key Notes

- Amex rewards good relationships - come back in 12 months for more
- Can transfer limits between Amex cards
- Co-branded cards (Delta, Hilton) often give better initial limits

### Chase

**Best For**: High limits with relationship

#### Premier Checking Strategy (Recommended)

1. Open Premier Checking Account
2. Deposit $3k
3. RM (Relationship Manager) calls same day
4. Apply with RM → bypasses geolock
5. **Expected**: $50k approval

#### Online Application Strategy

1. Open business checking account
2. Deposit $5k
3. Wait 5 business days
4. Log into client portal (from home, no VPN)

#### Second Card Strategy

- If first card is $30k+, apply for Chase Ink Preferred
- Expected: Another $30-50k
- Transfer limit to 0% card

#### Key Notes

- **Avoid virtual addresses** - use client's home address for LLC
- Apply from client's home IP (no VPN)
- Some RMs can do remote applications - ask!
- Randomize income numbers when using RMs

### Bank of America

**Best For**: Multiple cards with limit transfers

#### Strategy

1. Open any checking account
2. Apply for first business card
3. Wait 30 days → Second card
4. Wait 30 days → Third card (if under $15k deposits)

#### Tiers

- **Base Tier**: Any deposit amount → 2-3 cards
- **Second Tier**: $15k+ deposits → may get extra card

#### Key Notes

- Can transfer limits between all BofA cards
- Can merge all cards into one → cancel others → reapply in 7 months

### Citizens Bank

**Best For**: High limits, newer process

#### New Strategy (2024)

1. Call local branch (Google Maps → Citizens near client)
2. Request to apply online
3. Say "I don't have time for phone application, can you send a link?"
4. Apply using their private link
5. **Expected**: $35-50k

#### Requirements

- **LLC must be 6+ months old** (strict - will deny otherwise)
- Business credit history helps
- Place towards end of funding sequence

#### Key Notes

- Old public website link no longer works
- In-person applications still work
- Can create repeat business - come back in 6-12 months

### Elon Financial

**Best For**: Credit union cards with good limits

#### Strategy

1. Look up local Elon Financial branches by state
2. Call branch, request online application link
3. Apply using their link
4. **Expected**: $18k+

#### Key Notes

- Screen sharing may be flagged as fraud (one reported case)
- To be safe, have client apply from their own device

### Fifth Third Bank

**Status**: Testing (January 2026)

#### Potential Strategy

1. Open checking account
2. Deposit $5k

## Building a Credit Profile (Thin File Strategy)

### Requirements for Funding

- 4+ total primary personal accounts (not AUs)
- 3+ personal credit cards
- 1 card with $10k+ limit

### Build-Up Sequence

| Month | Action | Card Type | Purpose |
|-------|--------|-----------|---------|
| 1 | Add first card + Credit Strong | Discover or Citi | No credit history required |
| 2 | Add funding bank card | US Bank or Wells | Starts relationship |
| 3 | Add strong card | Credit Union (Credit Care) | Gets $10k+ limit |

### Timeline

- Minimum 3-4 months to build fundable profile
- Add authorized users if needed to boost score
- Space applications 30 days apart to avoid "too many new accounts"

### Handling Objections

Frame as: "We're building a long-term asset. Your credit profile will benefit you for cars, homes, and funding for years. There's no faster legitimate way to do this."

## Application Best Practices

### Done-With-You Model (Recommended)

1. Schedule Zoom call with client
2. Enable remote screen share
3. Walk through application together
4. Prevents mistakes (wrong name, nickname, etc.)

### Common Application Mistakes

- Using nickname instead of legal name
- Using maiden name instead of current name
- Wrong address format
- Inconsistent income numbers

### RM Tips

- Randomize income/revenue numbers slightly ($215k, $227k, not $225k every time)
- Ask if they can do remote applications
- Build relationships - send multiple clients their way

### Timing

- **Commitment**: Get client to block calendar time
- **Book-to-Book**: Always schedule next call before ending current one
- Check results 48 hours after application
- Follow up calls are critical for pushing decisions
