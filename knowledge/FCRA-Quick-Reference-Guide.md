## âš–ï¸ STANDING TEST (POST-TRANSUNION)

### Three-Part Test (ALL Required)

**1. CONCRETE HARM** âœ“
Must have at least ONE:
- âœ… Credit denial / adverse action
- âœ… Higher interest rates / insurance premiums
- âœ… Lost employment opportunity
- âœ… Financial loss (quantifiable)
- âœ… Emotional distress (with evidence)
- âœ… Material risk of future harm (circuit split)
- âŒ **NOT sufficient:** Bare procedural violation without downstream harm

**2. DISSEMINATION** âœ“
- âœ… Inaccurate report **furnished to third party**
- âœ… Report **accessed** by lender, employer, insurer, landlord
- âœ… Evidence: Inquiry on credit report, adverse action notice, lender records
- âŒ **NOT sufficient:** Inaccuracy exists in file but never accessed by anyone

**3. CAUSATION** âœ“
- âœ… Inaccurate information **caused** the harm
- âœ… "But for" test: Without inaccuracy, would plaintiff have been approved?
- âœ… Denial letter cites "credit issues" or "credit report"
- âš ï¸ Weakened if plaintiff has other credit problems

### Quick Standing Assessment

| Scenario | Standing? | Notes |
|----------|-----------|-------|
| Report furnished â†’ credit denied | âœ… **YES** | Strong standing |
| Report furnished â†’ higher rate | âœ… **YES** | Strong standing |
| Report furnished â†’ no adverse action | âš ï¸ **MAYBE** | Need material risk argument |
| Inaccuracy in file, never furnished | âŒ **NO** | Fails TransUnion test |
| Disclosure violation, no dissemination | âŒ **NO** | Post-TransUnion, likely fails |
| Employment report â†’ job denied | âœ… **YES** | Strong standing |

## ðŸ—ºï¸ CIRCUIT RANKINGS (PLAINTIFF-FRIENDLY)

### Best to Worst for FCRA Plaintiffs

| Rank | Circuit | Standing Approach | Notes | File Here If... |
|------|---------|------------------|-------|----------------|
| ðŸ¥‡ **1** | **9th Circuit** | Most lenient; broader "material risk" | CA, OR, WA, AZ, NV, ID, MT, AK, HI | Plaintiff has ANY connection |
| ðŸ¥ˆ **2** | **3rd Circuit** | Moderate; allows some risk-based standing | PA, NJ, DE | Strong case; East Coast venue needed |
| ðŸ¥‰ **3** | **7th Circuit** | Moderate; emphasizes traditional harms | IL, IN, WI | Midwest cases; decent precedent |
| **4** | **6th Circuit** | Moderate; case-by-case | MI, OH, KY, TN | Mixed; not terrible |
| **5** | **1st Circuit** | Limited case law; moderate | ME, NH, MA, RI | Few FCRA cases |
| **6** | **4th Circuit** | Moderate | MD, VA, WV, NC, SC | Some good precedent |
| **7** | **5th Circuit** | Conservative | TX, LA, MS | Avoid if possible |
| **8** | **8th Circuit** | Conservative | AR, IA, MN, MO, NE, ND, SD | Avoid if possible |
| **9** | **10th Circuit** | Limited case law | CO, KS, NM, OK, UT, WY | Few FCRA cases |
| ðŸš« **10** | **2nd Circuit** | **STRICTEST** standing requirements | NY, CT, VT | AVOID unless no choice |
| ðŸš« **11** | **11th Circuit** | Very strict, similar to 2nd | FL, GA, AL | AVOID unless no choice |

## ðŸ“ž INTAKE TRIAGE QUESTIONS

Ask these 5 questions on initial call:

1. **"What's inaccurate on your credit report?"**
   - Identifies potential Â§ 1681e(b) violation

2. **"Did you dispute it with the credit bureau?"**
   - Necessary for Â§ 1681i claim; check 30-day deadline

3. **"Were you denied credit, a job, or insurance?"**
   - Establishes concrete harm for standing

4. **"When did this happen?"**
   - Statute of limitations check (2-year discovery rule)

5. **"Do you have denial letters or adverse action notices?"**
   - Evidence of dissemination + causation

**Red Flags to Decline:**
- âŒ No dissemination (report never accessed by third party)
- âŒ Beyond statute of limitations
- âŒ Only minor/immaterial inaccuracies
- âŒ Plaintiff has many other credit problems (causation weak)
- âŒ No damages (approved anyway, no harm)

## ðŸ’¡ PRO TIPS

**âœ“ DO:**
- Always check standing first (TransUnion test)
- Send disputes via certified mail (proof of delivery)
- Document everything (dates, times, who you spoke with)
- Calculate damages before sending demand letter
- File in 9th Circuit if at all possible
- Request CRA's investigation file in discovery (often reveals sham investigation)

**âœ— DON'T:**
- Don't miss statute of limitations (calendar immediately)
- Don't skip the pre-adverse action notice in employment cases
- Don't assume standing without dissemination evidence
- Don't rely on online disputes (send certified mail)
- Don't file in 2nd or 11th Circuit unless no choice
