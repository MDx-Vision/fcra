## â“ COMMON QUESTIONS ANSWERED

**Q: This seems like a lot. Where do I actually start?**
A: Follow the 3-Step Quick Start above. Everything else can wait until Week 2.

**Q: Do I need to read all 36,000 words of the Framework immediately?**
A: No! Use it as a reference guide. Search for specific issues as they come up.

**Q: What if my first case doesn't fit the templates exactly?**
A: Adapt! Templates are starting points, not rigid rules. Use your judgment.

**Q: How soon can I take my first case?**
A: After Step 3 of Quick Start (2-3 hours total). You're ready!

**Q: What if I don't have staff?**
A: Perfect! SOPs become your personal checklist. Solo practice works great with this system.

**Q: Should I start with pre-litigation or direct litigation?**
A: Start with pre-litigation (dispute campaigns). Lower risk, faster learning curve.

**Q: What's the most important document in this system?**
A: Workflow Cheat Sheet. It's your daily operating manual. Everything else supports it.

**Q: How often should I update/review the system?**

## ðŸ”§ TROUBLESHOOTING

### "I'm stuck on customization"
â†’ Start with just your firm name, contact info, and fee structure
â†’ Rest can be filled in later as needed

### "My first case is taking forever"
â†’ Normal! Second case will be 50% faster. Third case 75% faster
â†’ Reference: You're learning, not inefficient

### "Client's situation doesn't match any template"
â†’ Use Framework for legal analysis
â†’ Adapt templates to fit
â†’ When in doubt, be conservative (decline if standing uncertain)

### "I don't know which strategy to choose"
â†’ Decision tree in Violation Spotter Flowchart
â†’ Default: Pre-litigation first (lower risk)
â†’ Go direct to litigation only if SOL urgent or very strong case

### "I need help with [specific legal issue]"
â†’ Search Framework using specific terms
â†’ Check Project Knowledge
â†’ Review relevant case law (Framework Section 30)

---

## ðŸ’¡ PRO TIPS FROM THE SYSTEM

### Tip #1: Standing First, Always
80% of declined cases have standing issues. Check this BEFORE deep analysis.

### Tip #2: Document Everything
Every call, every letter, every deadline. If it's not documented, it didn't happen.

### Tip #3: Calendar Obsessively
SOL deadlines, 30-day dispute responses, 15-day demand deadlines. NEVER miss.

### Tip #4: Start Simple
Don't try to use every feature on Day 1. Master basic workflow first.

### Tip #5: Trust the Process
System seems complex initially. After 3-5 cases, it becomes second nature.

### Tip #6: Quality Over Quantity
Better to handle 5 cases excellently than 15 cases poorly.

### Tip #7: Under-Promise, Over-Deliver
Tell clients: "4-6 months." Deliver in 3. They'll love you.
