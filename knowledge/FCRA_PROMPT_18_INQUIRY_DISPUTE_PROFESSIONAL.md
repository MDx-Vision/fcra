# PHASE 5: SECOND CFPB COMPLAINT (ESCALATION)

---

## 2nd CFPB COMPLAINT — STEP-BY-STEP GUIDE

**Website:** https://www.consumerfinance.gov/complaint/

**Note:** File separate complaints for each non-compliant bureau


### Questions 1-2: Same as First Complaint

Select "Credit reporting or other personal consumer reports" and "Credit reporting"


### Question 3: Problem Type (DIFFERENT)

### Question 4: Problem Description

**Select:** Their investigation did not fix an error on your report


### Question 5: Prior Resolution Attempts

**Select:** Yes


### Question 6: Information Request

**Select:** No

Click Next


### Question 7: Escalation Narrative

**Copy and customize the following text:**

I am writing to follow up on a previous complaint concerning inaccuracies in my credit report, specifically related to unauthorized inquiries resulting from identity theft. Despite diligent efforts to resolve this issue, the credit bureau has failed to rectify the inaccuracies in compliance with the Fair Credit Reporting Act (FCRA).

After filing an FTC identity theft report, I identified unauthorized inquiries that should not appear on my credit file. Pursuant to FCRA Section 609B and the identity theft provisions under FCRA 605B (15 U.S.C. § 1681c-2), I demanded immediate removal of these inquiries within four business days. The credit bureau has not taken the required action.

I have contacted the credit bureau directly to request removal of these inquiries, but my requests were not honored. This demonstrates non-compliance with 15 U.S.C. § 1681s-2, which prohibits furnishing information known or reasonably believed to be inaccurate.

I provided a detailed 609B dispute letter and followed up with phone calls. Despite these efforts, the bureau's investigation concluded without rectifying the inaccuracies, contradicting 15 U.S.C. § 1681i(5), which requires deletion or modification of unverified or inaccurate information.

Furthermore, the bureau has failed to provide a comprehensive description of the reinvestigation process as required under 15 U.S.C. § 1681i(7).

The continued presence of these inaccuracies violates the FCRA and has a detrimental impact on my financial wellbeing. I request the Bureau's intervention to ensure compliance with federal law.

Disputed Inquiries:

1. [CREDITOR NAME] ([DATE]) — Remove pursuant to FCRA 605B
2. [CREDITOR NAME] ([DATE]) — Remove pursuant to FCRA 605B


### Question 8: Desired Resolution

**Copy and customize:**

Delete these hard inquiries: [CREDITOR 1] ([DATE]), [CREDITOR 2] ([DATE]). The bureau's failure to properly investigate has violated my rights under the Fair Credit Reporting Act.


### Question 9: Document Upload

**Upload:** FTC Report PDF AND 609 Letter copies


### Questions 10-13: Same as First Complaint

Complete company identification and personal information sections.


### Expected Outcome

Inquiries should be removed within one week of filing the escalation complaint. Maintain records of all interactions and documents for potential legal action if necessary.
